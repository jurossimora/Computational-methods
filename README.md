# 2022 Scientific Computing Intro

Welcome! This is a demo repository with the example of a data analysis' project using R.

## Project structure

```

In the `R` directory you will find the scripts. Let's start using R!

ok

organizing a script:

a header containing who, how, when, where, and why METADATA

a part loading all needed packages from the begining with library()*

reads needed data (empty workspace)

Coding a variable that will not change

Commenting every step

Writing in the HD the result from each step
